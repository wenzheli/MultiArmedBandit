MultiArmedBandit,  Matlab implementation
================

Comparison of different multi-armd bandit algorithm, based on simulated data. 

The code contains Matlab implementation of following band algorithms:
  - \epsilon greedy
  - \epsilon_{n} greddy
  - UCB
  - Pursuit
  - Softmax
  - Exp3
  
This is one of my previous course project - http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/nikolova/Teaching/CSCE689_fall2011/

The ComparisonOfBanditAlgorithm.pdf (my report)  contains the all the algorithm details and comparisons.
